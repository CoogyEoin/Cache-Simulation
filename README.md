# Cache-Simulation
This is C++ program that simulates three different cache designs, associative, direct mapping and two-way associative cache.

The main function in FormalElement.cpp is the model for the two-way associative cache and the other two models are in their respective functions.
The addresses that were used for testing are in the address.txt file.
